# macOS LaunchAgents

This folder contains custom macOS X LaunchAgents for a few applications that don't come with their own.
See the [repo wiki](https://github.com/davidnewhall/autotyed/wiki) for more information about how to use these.

Note:

The most up to date version of [com.github.davidnewhall.unpacker-poller.plist](com.github.davidnewhall.unpacker-poller.plist) is provided from its [respective repo](https://github.com/davidnewhall/unpacker-poller). Installation
of this application is highly recommended if you use Deluge.

Tautulli comes with an install script that fabricates a LaunchAgent file. The
agent provided here logs to a specific file; that's the only real difference.
