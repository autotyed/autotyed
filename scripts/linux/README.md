# Linux Installation Scripts

The standalone scripts in this folder can be used to install and in some cases
pre-configure specific open source software. You can use `make install` to run
these scripts automatically, in order, or you may choose to run them manually.

derp. there's nothing here yet. Linux users? Help me out! I like pull requests.
